## World Anvil Issue Tracker

This is the public repository to track issues found on [World Anvil](https://worldanvil.com). This includes anything that does not work the way you expect it to, it includes typos or if you wish there was additional documentation on a topic or tool.

Do not make feature requests here. A feature request is anything that expands on the existing functionality.

### How to report an issue?

In order to report an issue you will need a GitHub account. You can use [this](https://github.com/join) link to join. Just follow the instructions!

Once you have an account go to the Issues tab above. Use the search function to see if your issue was already reported. If it was then add a comment to the issue instead of making a new one. This might help the team track down the issue faster and increase the priority.

If you didn't find your issue reported press the green New Issue button. Follow the instructions of the text and fill in all the necessary information to make it easier to track down the bugs you have encountered.

Make sure to add a meaningful title to the issue to ensure that it can be found easily.

Thank you for your report!
